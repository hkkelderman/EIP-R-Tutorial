## Environmental Integrity Project - R Tutorial


I work as a research analyst at an environmental non-profit based in Washington, DC called the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP). I started out as a regular data analyst, but as I grew into my position I started teaching myself R and Python to help automate some of my work and make other aspects easier. Since I've learned these languages, I'm really the only one at the organization that uses them. I created this tutorial in R as a way to indtroduce to my fellow researchers some of the capabilities of R, showcase some of the functions and code I use regularly that help make my job easier, and hopefully encourage them to start learning the language on their own.
